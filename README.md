**GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework 5**

This repository includes two separate challenges

### Pyber

Pyber uses a scatterplot and pie charts to visualize ride share data across different city types (urban, suburban, rural).

### Pymaceuticals Inc

Pymaceuticals Inc is the more complex of the two challenges and uses error charts, a scatterplot, and a bar chart to visualize changes in tumor volume and metastatic spread as well as mouse survival rate in a clinical trial done on mice.

**For more information on these projects, please see their individual folders.**
